          Supernotes entirely independent and under our ownership, in line with
          our commitment to establishing an everlasting, sustainable product.
          Here’s the full story…

          We all want something different today
        </h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-zinc-200 box-border caret-transparent my-[18px]">
          Somewhere along the way, expectations and needs changed. Our world
          shifted from “give me a great tool for taking notes” to “give me an
          everything-app that reads my mind, answers my questions, and manages
          my life.” We felt that pressure up close. Should Supernotes handle
          files? Calendars? Tasks? Email? The gravitational pull toward
          “everything” is strong, and this pull has been infinitely compounded
          by the onset of LLMs and Generative AI.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-zinc-200 box-border caret-transparent my-[18px]">
          We’ve debated taking those paths many times, because we know that
          every time we bolt on another feature, the tool risks losing its
          sharpness. Chasing the everything app dilutes the exact quality that
          makes Supernotes feel great: intentionality. That’s why, over and over
          again, we’ve chosen to innovate within notes rather than stapling on
          another generic module. Features like our newly released{" "}

          Could we raise VC investment to compete with giants that roll multiple
          products into one? Perhaps. But scaling a feature checklist isn’t the
          same as building a great tool.

          sustainable team would mean raising money and committing to a growth

          it’s not what our users trust us for.

        </h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-zinc-200 box-border caret-transparent my-[18px]">
          Since the release of GPT-3 our Community has been asking for more AI
          in Supernotes. GenAI is incredibly exciting and one of the biggest
          paradigm shifts in software for a generation. So like everyone else,
          we experimented. We built many AI prototypes, we tried a wave of
          AI-enhanced notetakers, and we kept bumping into the same feeling –
          these tools automate existing habits rather than help you build better
          ones. They make you passive.{" "}

          If we retrofitted Supernotes to follow that trend, we’d risk
          flattening the deliberate experience that the members of our diverse
          community have come to love. The end result was excitement about AI
          combined with a reluctance to add too much of it to Supernotes. We
          traded notes with other teams wrestling with the same trade-offs –
          from chats on our doorstep with Granola &amp; startups in London to
          coffees with Notion &amp; VCs in San Francisco. Those conversations

          We were intrigued, so in July we flew out to spend time at their
          office in San Francisco, and something clicked. Their vision, “build
          your digital mind,” aligned up with our own curiosity about how people
          can interact with knowledge, reflect, and learn. But unlike
          Supernotes’ manual ethos, Delphi is AI-first by design. It isn’t just
          another chat box; their prototypes ask questions, nudge deeper
          understanding, and push beyond the limits of today’s GPT-shaped
          interfaces. Helping you save the most precious resource you have –

          As anyone reading this probably understands, we care deeply about user
          trust. And we think Delphi’s approach is best-in-class in this regard:
          you can only make a Delphi of yourself (no characters, no adult
          themes), and the team’s ethics and guardrails have taken a concept
          that could be dystopian but have instead made it feel human, not
          hollow. Backed by top investors and advisors, they have the resources
          and ambition to pursue a true blue-sky interface for thinking. We were
          excited at the chance to help responsibly shape that future.
